# QA Practice Project with Jira & Qase Simulation

This repository contains practical exercises and a simulation of working as a QA engineer in an Agile team using Jira for task management and (simulated) Qase for test management. 
The goal is to demonstrate an understanding of the testing process, test documentation creation, and defect tracking.

## Folder Structure:

* **`user-stories/`:** Contains Markdown files describing User Stories for different functionalities.
* **`acceptance-criteria/`:** (Optional) May contain separate files with Acceptance Criteria.
* **`test-cases/`:** Contains folders organized by test type (`functional/`, `usability/`, `performance/`, `security/`, etc.), with subfolders for individual functionalities (e.g., `login/`, `registration/`, `shopping_cart/`). Each test case is described in a separate Markdown file.
* **`bug-reports/`:** Contains Markdown files with bug reports, resembling the structure of Jira.
* **`test-plans/`:** May contain test plans for different levels (sprint, functionality).
* **`test-results/`:** May contain summarized results of test executions.
* **`documentation/`:** Any other related documentation (e.g., a description of the test environment - if a simulated one exists).

## Simulated Sprint:

In this repository, we will simulate the work of a single sprint, including core functionalities such as:

* New user registration
* Existing user login
* Product browsing
* Adding a product to the shopping cart

For each of these functionalities, User Stories (in Jira - simulated), Acceptance Criteria, test cases (in Qase - simulated) will be created, and the process of reporting and fixing bugs (in Jira - simulated) will be tracked.

## Simulated Tools:

* **Jira:** For managing User Stories, tasks, and tracking bugs. Markdown files resembling Jira Issues will be created in the repository.
* **Qase:** For creating, organizing, and (simulated) executing test cases. Test cases will be described in Markdown files following a structure similar to Qase.

## How to Explore the Repository:

Explore the folders and files to see examples of User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, test cases, and bug reports. Pay attention to the structure and the information contained in each file.

This repository is created for educational purposes and demonstrates an understanding of basic QA processes and tools.
